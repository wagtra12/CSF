Problem 1:

GC-content: 0.43029262963

(No answers in this file.)

Problem 2:

When i commented out the seq = "" and also the linenum = 0, i received a syntax error saying linenum wasnt defined on line 40. Since we put # the program skipped when we 
established a value to the variables.


Problem 3:

when i commented out the gc_count = 0, the program came back as a name error on line 66. Name error: name 'gc_count' is not defined. Since we put a
# before the gc count the program never recognized gc count = 0. So it was adding 1 to nothing.


Problem 4:

GC-Content: 0.43029262963
