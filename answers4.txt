Homework 4

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file along with your modified
dna_analysis.py program


Problem 4:

GC-Content: 0.43029262963
AT-Content: 0.568993851852

Problem 5:

a-content: 7,701,287
T-content: 7,661,547
G-content: 5,738,773
C-content: 5,879,128

Problem 6: The file test test-high-gc-1.fastq had a number that was different. The sum was smaller than the total count 
and len(seq). I opened up the file and realized that there was a variable N. This is going to make the sums differ 
because we had not assigned a value to N in the total count. In the test-small.fastq they were all the same because 
there was no variable n to be counted.

gcat= 26,980,735
total_count=27,000,000
total_length=27,000,000


Problem 7:

AT/GC ratio= 1.32234161747

Problem 8:

moderate

Reflection: Spent hours testing how my attempts to find ratios worked.

New and challenging set of questions. Had to learn command line on my computer and glad i did.
