print "\nNow we will introduce nested data structures."

print "So now you can make dictionaries, and you know how to index nested data structures, "

print "you could have dictionaries with lists inside of them, or even keys, with lists as its value."
print "Or many others that we wont go over here."
move_on = raw_input("\npress enter to move on: ")

print "\nThere are several ways to make a nested data structure, we will stick to a simple one."
print "And a way we think is a clean way to do it, specifically with lists with dictionaries inside."
print "First you can make the dictionaries, such as: "

dict1 = {"Apple" : 1.00, "Bananas": 1.25, "Pear" : 1.00}
dict2 = {"Apple" : 1.25, "Bananas" : 1.45, "Pear" : 1.50}

print "\nThen you need to make the list with the dictionaries inside of it, we will call it nest_list: "
nest_list = [dict1, dict2]

print "\nnest_list = [dict1,dict2]"
print "\nThe result would look like this: "
print nest_list

print '\nSo using our two dictionaries names "dictionary" and "test_diction",'
print "make a nested data structure. You can call it nested_list."
print "\nNote that since its a list, with dictionaries inside, the order does matter, "
print 'so lets order it with "dictionary" first and "test_diction" next.'

nested_list = [dictionary, test_diction]

user_nest = raw_input("\nEnter here: ")
leave = "n"

	if user_nest == 'nested_list = [dictionary, test_diction]':

		print "Incorrect!"
		print "Look at the examples if you're having a hard time remember how to make the structure."
		user_nest = raw_input("Try again: ")

move_on = raw_input("Press enter to move on: ")





print "Alright so now you can make a nested data structure for our purpose."
print "Next we want to understand for loops and how useful they can be with lists and dictionaries."

print "\nFirst we will look at a simple for loop: "
print "\nfor i in range(10):"
print "    print i"
print "Should return this: "
for i in range(10):
	print i

move_on = raw_input("\nPress enter to move on: ")

print "For loops don't just use the range function, they can be used for most any sequence."

print "for <variable name> in <seqence>:"
print "    <do code until loop is over> "

move_on = raw_input("\nPress enter to move on: ")

print "    print i "
print "\nShould return: "

	print i

move_on = raw_input("\nPress enter to move on:")


print "\nNow we can show you how useful a for loop can be with data structures, such as a list:"
print "test_list = [5,3,2,7,3,1,4,6,7]"
print "for i in test_list:"
print "    print i"
print "Would return this: "
test_list = [5,3,2,7,3,1,4,6,7]
for i in test_list:
	print i


move_on = raw_input("\nPress enter to move on:")

print "\nNow we want to go through a dictionary with a for loop: "
print "We can even use the exisiting dictionary we already made named test_diction."
print "for i in test_diction:"
print "    print i"
print "\nWould return this: "

test_diction = {"apple" : 0.45, "cherries" : 2.50, "pear" : 1.00}
for i in test_diction:
	print i


dict1 = {"Apple" : 1.00, "Bananas": 1.25, "Pear" : 1.00}
dict2 = {"Apple" : 1.25, "Bananas" : 1.45, "Pear" : 1.50}

nest_list = [dict1, dict2]

move_on = raw_input("Press enter to move on:")


print "Now we can go through a nested data structure using the nested structure we made earlier named nest_list, like so: "
print "for i in nest_list:"
print "    print i"

print "\nShould return: "
for i in nest_list:
	print i

move_on = raw_input("Press enter to move on: ")



print "\nSo now we want to be able to go through specific items in the nested data structure, "
print "to do this we would type something like this: "
print "for i in range(len(nest_list)):"
print '    print nest_list[i]["Apple"]'



for i in range(len(nest_list)):
	print nest_list[i]["Apple"]

print "\nSo this loop is using the len() function, which grabs the length of the nest_list, having 2 dictionaries inside of it, "
print "gives it the length of 2. The indent on the inside of the for loop prints the nest_list[i], the first iteration is 0 "
print 'so it would print the 0th dictionary, then the nest part is asking for the key "Apple", which returns the value of apple.'
print 'The next iteration through the loop turns the "i" into a 1, and prints the "Apple" value in the second dictionary.'


move_on = raw_input("Press enter to move on: ")

print "\nNow we will have you go ahead and print out the values of the \"Pear\" in each dictionary using a for loop."
print "Using the same list, nest_list."
user_loop = raw_input("Enter here: ")


print "\nFirst we will have you do the for loop setup, then after that we will write the second half of the code."

leave = "n"
while leave == "n":

	if user_loop == "for i in range(len(nest_list)):":
		print "Correct!"
		leave = "y"

	else:
		print "Incorrect!"

loop_scope = raw_input("Enter here: ")

leae = "n"
while leave == "n":

print "\nAwesome! Now we will run the same loop but we will use a function inside of the loop to tell us which store has the lowest prices."



from math import sqrt

print "So to start off we will recall how to call functions. An example of a function call would be: sqrt():"
print "The name of this function is sqrt, the parameters would go into the brackets and would return the square root of the arguement entered."
print "An example would be: "
print "sqrt(25)"
print "Would return: "
print sqrt(25)


move_on = raw_input("Press enter to move on: ")

print "\nYou can also use functions inside of a loop, say we want to get the sqaure root of all the numbers from 25 to 50:"

print "So now we will have you go ahead and use a for loop similar to ours, but instead we will use a different function."
print "This function is called square(). It takes one arguement just like the sqrt function, we want you to make an empty list, "
