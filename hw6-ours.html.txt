Problem 3 (What is Assert doing?)
In your homework file, define a = 5 and b = 5.
Then add “assert a == b” 

What is the code giving you?

Now change b = 10

What is the code giving you? 

What exactly is assert verifying in this step?

Problem 4 (Defining a function and calling a function)
Add C = 2 to the list of variables to problem 1.
Create a function that gives the sum of “X” and “Y” then divided it by Z

Call the function by 

print dv(a, b, c) to give the result of (a*b)/c 




Problem 5 (What is the differences of Tuples, Lists, Dictionaries)

Create a Tuples list with 4 child name 
reminder: tuples uses []
Notes:
* Tuples are mutable therefore you cannot change the values once its set.
Create a Lists with 4 child ages 

Notes:
reminder: list uses ()
to add to a list we use .append(‘value’) to add to a list
to delete a list we use: del name[index]
Create a Dictionary list with mother phone number 
Notes:
reminder: dictionary use {}
to add to dictionary we use name[‘associate’] = value
to delete we use: del name[‘associate’]


Problem 6 (Creating nested list and accessing lists)
Create list_a and list_b with even same amount of variables in there. Make a new list_c with the sum of list_a and list_b indexes. 


Problem 7 ()

Merge two list
